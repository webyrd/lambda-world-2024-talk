# lambda-world-2024-talk

Code for my Lambda World 2024 talk

This repository contains a modified version of Bharath Joshi's metaKanren, supporting miniKanren syntax (`conde`, untagged procedure calls) and the ability to define and call Scheme functions.

The repository also contains updated tests, and a transcript from the second part of my live coding from my talk.
